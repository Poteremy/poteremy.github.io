              <h4>Aside from the actual answer of <em>how</em> it happened, we're not really sure to be honest. We were actively trying for a while, and then when Tara's health concerns became what they are, we took a break from actively trying. And then one day, POOF! A magical pregnancy test came back positive. She took a few tests over the course of the next few days just to be sure, and that was that!</h4>

              <h4>Not inherently. Along with POTS, Tara is diagnosed with Vasovagal Syncope. The only real risk posed to the baby would be if she lost consciousness which resulted in direct trauma to her belly. The condition itself does not pose any risk.</h4>
